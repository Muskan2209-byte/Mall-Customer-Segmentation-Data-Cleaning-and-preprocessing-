Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer behaviors and spot patterns for segmentation.

ðŸ“Š Suggested EDA Steps:
1. Basic Stats & Visuals
Age distribution
Gender ratio
Income vs Spending Score scatter plot
Pairplot to see variable interactions

2. Group Insights
Average income/spending by gender
Age groups vs spending behavior

3. Visual Tools
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

Example: Age distribution
sns.histplot(df['age'], bins=10, kde=True)
plt.title("Age Distribution")
plt.show()

Once EDA is done, we can run K-Means Clustering to segment customers into groups (e.g., low spenders, high income etc)
